<p>A reformatting of Jerry D’s response into a Microsoft Word letter .</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>When I decided to create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">political</code> section of my blog, I had grandiose visions of writing essays on the big political issues of the day. But In Real Life, the first political issue to come up since the blog got started is a very local community issue. Politics begins at the community level, so this is a good first political post.</p>

<p>The current owner of the golf course embedded in our community is Mustang Development. Mustang Development is also the declarant for our community’s master HOA, Community Preservation Association (CPA). CPA is the master HOA for multiple neighborhoods in our small town. Mustang Development has offered to sell the golf course land (but not the operations) to the CPA HOA. Myself and many other homeowners object to this. Phil Rubin distributed, and Jerry Dwinell posted, a “form-letter” response to CPA for homeowners wishing to vote “No”. This form letter was distributed to many of us as a text file, which is fine for e-mail and Facebook, but not so good for printing. I wanted to send my vote in by mail, so I needed to create a version of the response formatted for printing. I also needed a version suitable for property held by a Trust. I chose Microsoft Word as the editor for creating the formatted response.</p>

<p>There are two documents, one is a short letter with just the information necessary to vote.
The other is a longer letter with the voting information and setting out many reasons to vote no.</p>

<p>Both are written for homeowners whose property is owned by a trust. The trustees of the trust should be the ones to sign these letters. Disclaimer: I am not an attorney, this is not legal advice. If you have questions regarding your specific situation, consult an attorney.</p>
