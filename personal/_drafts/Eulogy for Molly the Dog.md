## Introduction

I didn't think that the very first post I'd make under this personal section would be in memory of Molly. She went from healthy to deathly in just three weeks, between the birthday of this site and before the release of V0.03. So here I am putting the site to it's first public use as a tribute to a Good Dog.

We got Molly as a rescue in <date>. JoAnn and Alex picked her out; I was sandbagged the day after returning from a gig. After reluctantly agreeing, they had her home by the next day. Her papers had her as Dolly, but JoAnn wanted a per with *moxy*, so Dolly became Roxy; but she was such a sweet and self-effacing thing, that by the next week, we all agreed that she didn't have enough *moxie* to be a *Roxy*, so Molly she became and stayed for the next 13 years.

The vets estimated her at 9 months when we got her.

Molly had a good dog life. She got to grow up with her boy becoming a man, swimming and tubing, hiking, camping, even snow sports. As a grand dame, she spent a year in urban Charlotte, and became comfortable with life in the big city.  She spent her retirement year in Park City and Deer Valley, hiking many afternoons in the mountains with her family. She was even a good sport about being costumed for Halloween! She lived to an estimated fourteen, and departed  from us in April of 2021. I hope this gallery reminds us all oof teh good times we had together, and the memories she is taking along with her on the next stage of our journey.
