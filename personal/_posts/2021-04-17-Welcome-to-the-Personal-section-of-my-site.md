I've long hoped to have a website that I can use to share information with my friends and family, without having to create content for each individual social media site. This is it!

If you would like to have access to my posts and pictures about family and friends, direct message me via text message, e-mail or a phone call. I'll add you to the list of people who have access.
In the future, I hope to have a simple login form that will make it very easy to authenticate using any of your social media apps, or using a userid / password.

## Pictures and Videos

I have our cameras and GoPro setup to automatically upload new media to my Dropbox storage. Since I'm already paying Dropbox for 2 TB of storage, I thought I'd simply utilize that space as the place to host media aas seen in my posts. DropBox lets me create a sharing link and it is easy to put that link into my posts. This way, the media is delivered to your browser from Dropbox (and eventually Cloudflare).

Here is an example of a picture.

   Your browser does not support embedded videos, however, you can see the video in a new tab [[JoAnn skiing in costume on Closing Day at Park City Ski Resort  2021 04 11](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3vjhbk1ewf8u327/2021%2004%2011%20Park%20City%20Closing%20Day%20Capers.mp4?raw=1)
