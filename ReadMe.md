Welcome

Behind the scenes of a Blog site hosted by GitHub Pages. Bill's Blog aims to provide insights into how Bill's repositorys relate to one another. This is the code, content, and tooling that makes it all happen.

We belive that every project should also be a teaching tool. These are a series of posts that go into great detail how this site hangs together to deliver its goods to a reader.

Where some Blog site themes discuss having Portfolios, this site has Repositorys. There are five so far, as shown in the site's home page carousal. We have the Ace Commander project, the ATAP Utilities library of packages, the StronglyTypedPhilote teaching repository, BillHertzing.github.io whish is this site's repository, and a directory OpenSourceProjects, under which I place all forks of other OSS projects I'm working with.

Goal

Make the process of writing and maintaining good posts easier.

The site build posts will document how the site was built,including the tooling.
