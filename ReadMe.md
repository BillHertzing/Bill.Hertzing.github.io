# Welcome to Bill's Blog

This is the source code for the static User GitHub Pages site "Bill's Blog".

ToDo: add more badges

This is behind the scenes of a [Bill's Blog](https://billhertzing.github.io), a static-pages blog site hosted by GitHub Pages.  This is the code, content, and tooling that makes creation of the site all happen.  I believe that every project should also be a teaching tool. There are a series of posts that go into great detail how this site hangs together to deliver its goods to a reader.

## Goals

The overarching goal of my blog site is to provide a place where the interrelationships of my repositorys are explained. I also use the site to post technical knowledge transfer posts of interests to the programming community.

In addition to the technical use, I use my blog site to publish information and opinions about political topics, and publish pictures and short write-ups about happenings of interest to friends and family members, which I then share on social media platforms.

I hope to learn, and teach, tools and methods that make the process of writing, maintaining, and publishing good posts easier. You will find a series of posts on "How I setup this GitHub Pages blog site" *ToDo: link to a specific archive page listing these posts* which aspire to accomplish this goal.

The goal towards which all the coding and database repositories strive is the creation of a distributed application that acts like a comic-book personal assistance, similar to Ironman's Jarvis, which was an alpha-level AI personality for doing good. *ToDo: link to post describing the goal of the AceCommander repository*

The logo and Favicon on this site is currently a design I had created when I ran ATAP Technology, Inc. However, I'd like a logo which represents an abstraction of the visualization of a partial Jarvis-like AI's neural network.

Guest Blogs are welcome. If the site becomes popular there will be adjustments in it's direction as others join to collaborate towards the goal. Hopefully, we can build a community working together towards realizing AceCommander!

## Repositories

One of the aims of this site is to provide insights into how Bill's repositorys relate to one another. Where some blog site themes discuss having Portfolios, this site has Repositorys. There are five so far, as shown in the site's *home page carousal (Still in draft)*. We have the AceCommander project, the ATAP Utilities library of packages, the StronglyTypedPhilote teaching repository, BillHertzing.github.io which is this site's repository, and a directory OpenSourceProjects, under which I place all forks of other OSS projects I'm working with.

*ToDo: More to come!*
