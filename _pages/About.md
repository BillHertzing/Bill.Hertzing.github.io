## About Me

My interest in electronics started in high school in the early 70's, dumpster diving behind TV and HiFi repair shops. It was nurtured with a BScEE degree from the Georgia Institute of Technology (Ga. Tech). I started my career with hardware design work, then switched to software stating with hardware drivers, graphical interfaces, concurrent operating systems kernel stuff. Then back for a good long hardware project, lots of assembly microcode for three cooperating CPUs on the same card. Then another interesting job with as team lead on a 10-person project Unix, Mainframes, Oracle and a rules-based AI.  Then a (relatively short) three year stint in management (four groups of ten persons), that ended with a corporate conversion to SAP, where I led a team doing a very significant ETL project using Oracle DB queries, Perl and ABAP. The internet came along about that time. I was in the right place and time to meet the folks at SAP's Advanced Research group in Palo Alto, and I did a couple of years as an independent consultant helping customers setup SAP's first web-enabled browser-accessible offering. That job led me directly to a startup called Tealeaf, which I joined as the Director of Professional Services. We did TCP/IP/HTTP/HTML traffic analysis, and browser-based replay of user sessions, based on the TCP/IP data tapped/sniffed at the point of entry to our customer's data centers. Fast forward 23 years later, the startup was successful and I finished a long career in the computer field. I'm currently retired, and working on Open Source Software (OSS) projects.

## About this blog

This blog is what Github refers to as a User' blog site, as opposed to a Project blog site.
I started this blog to communicate, to build a community interested in a design dream, and to have a place to air my opinions, and a place to post about things in my family life, too. See my `political` post [Why I wanted a Blog]({{ '/political/2021/2021-04-17-Why-I-wanted-a-Blog.html' | relative_url }})

The left side of many pages has a sidebar navigation menu that navigates you to some of my OSS repositories. Each repository has conceptual documents that provide how the code in the repository hangs together to provide . in addition to the conceptual documentation, each repository also has the code documentation. Both kinds of documentation are hosted in a Github Project blog site. The documentation is written in Markdown, and the code documentation is extracted from "triple slash (///)" comments in the code base using DocFx as a static site generator. Github Pages hosts the static documentation site for each repository.
