## TL DR

If you would like to have access to my posts and pictures about family and friends, direct message me via text message e-mail, or a phone call. I'll add you to the list of people who have access.

In the future, I hope to have a simple login form that will make it very easy to authenticate using any of your social media apps, or using a userid / password.

## Welcome

I've long hoped to have a website that I can use to share information with my friends and family, without having to create content for each individual social media site. This is it!

## Pictures and Videos

I have our cameras and GoPro setup to automatically upload new media to my Dropbox storage. Since I'm already paying Dropbox for 2 TB of storage, I thought I'd simply utilize that space as the place to host media for you to see in my posts. DropBox lets me create a sharing link, so it is easy to put that link into my posts, so that you will get the media delivered to your browser from Dropbox instead of any other third-party cloud storage.

Here is an example of a picture.

### Example video

Here is an example of a video. ToDo: embed a player so a user doesn't have to "open in new window"
